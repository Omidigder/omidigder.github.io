        <h1> Hydropower is energy in moving water
        </h1>
        <br />

        <p>People have a long history of using the force of water flowing in streams and rivers to produce mechanical
            energy. Hydropower was one of the first sources of energy used for electricity generation and is the largest
            single renewable energy source for electricity generation in the different countries</p>
        <h2> Hydropower relies on the water cycle
        </h2>
        <p> Understanding the water cycle is important to understanding hydropower. The water cycle has three steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.Solar energy heats water on the surface of rivers, lakes, and oceans, which causes the water to
                evaporate.</li>
            <li>2.Water vapor condenses into clouds and falls as precipitation—rain and snow.</li>
            <li>3.Precipitation collects in streams and rivers, which empty into oceans and lakes, where it evaporates
                and begins the cycle again</li>

        </ul>
        <p>The amount of precipitation that drains into rivers and streams in a geographic area determines the amount of
            water available for producing hydropower. Seasonal variations in precipitation and long-term changes in
            precipitation patterns, such as droughts, have a big impact on hydropower production.</p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h2> <span> power is produced with moving water</span></h2>
        <p> Because the source of hydroelectric power is water, hydroelectric power plants are usually located on or
            near a water source. <a
                href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained//index.php?page=electricity_in_the_united_states#tab2"
                target="-blank" rel="">The volume of the water flow </a>and the change in elevation (or fall) from one
            point to
            another determine the amount of available energy in moving water. Swiftly flowing water in a big river, such
            as the Columbia River that forms the border between Oregon and Washington, carries a great deal of energy in
            its flow. Water descending rapidly from a high point, such as Niagara Falls in New York, also has
            substantial energy in its flow.</p>
            <br/>
        <h> History of hydropower:
        </h>
        <p> Hydropower is one of the oldest sources of energy for producing mechanical and electrical energy. Hydropower
            was used thousands of years ago to turn paddle wheels to help grind grain. Before steam power and
            electricity were available in the United States, grain and lumber mills were powered directly with
            hydropower. The first industrial use of hydropower to generate electricity in the United States occurred in
            1880, when 16 brush-arc lamps were powered using a water turbine at the Wolverine Chair Factory in Grand
            Rapids, Michigan. The first U.S. hydroelectric power plant opened on the Fox River near Appleton, Wisconsin,
            on September 30, 1882. Most U.S. hydroelectricity is now produced at large dams on major rivers, and most of
            these hydroelectric dams were built before the mid-1970s.

                <p>Before embarking on any <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Hydroelectric_dam"

                    proposed site to
                    calculate the amount of available hydro power. <br />
                    Hydropower or hydroelectricity refers to the conversion of<a
                        href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Hydroelectric_dam  " target="-blank"> energy
                    </a>from flowing water
                    into
                    electricity. It is considered a renewable energy source because the water cycle is constantly
                    renewed by the sun[1].

                    Historically, one of the first uses of hydro power was for mechanical milling, such as grinding
                    grains[2]. Today, modern hydro plants produce electricity using turbines and generators, where
                    mechanical energy is created when moving water spins rotors on a turbine. This turbine is
                    connected
                    to an electromagnetic generator, which produce<a

                        electricity</a> when the turbine
                    spins.<br />

                    <h> There are three main types of hydro plants</h>

                        <li>Run-of-river facilities rely more on natural water flow rates, diverting just a portion
                            of
                            river water through turbines, sometimes without the use of a dam or reservoirs. Since
                            run-of-river hydro is subject to natural water <a

                <h5>Types of Hydropower Plants</h5>
                <p> There are three types of hydropower facilities: impoundment, diversion, and pumped storage. Some
                    hydropower plants use dams and some do not. The images below show both types of hydropower
                    plants.

                    Many dams were built for other purposes and hydropower was added later. In the United States,
                    there
                    are about 80,000 dams of which only 2,400 produce power. The other dams are for recreation,
                    stock/farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.

                    Hydropower plants range in size from small systems for a home or village to large projects
                    producing
                    electricity for utilities. The sizes of hydropower plants are described below.</p>
                <p> The most common type of hydroelectric power plant is an impoundment facility. An impoundment
                    facility,
                    typically a large hydropower system, uses a dam to store river water in a reservoir. Water
                    released
                    from
                    the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to
                    produce
                    electricity. The water may be released either to meet changing electricity needs or to maintain
                    a
                    constant reservoir level.</p>
                <p> Another type of hydropower called pumped storage works like a battery, storing the electricity
                    generated by other power sources like solar, wind, and nuclear for later use. It stores energy
                    by
                    pumping water uphill to a reservoir at higher elevation from a second reservoir at a lower
                    elevation. When the demand for electricity is low, a pumped storage facility stores energy by
                    pumping water from a lower reservoir to an upper reservoir </p>

                <li>Dam. Raises the water level of the river to create falling water. Also controls the flow of water.
                </li>

                <li> Turbine. The force of falling water pushing against the turbine's blades causes the turbine to
                    spin. A
                    water turbine is much like a windmill, except the energy is provided by falling water instead of
                    wind.
                    The turbine converts the kinetic energy of falling water into mechanical energy.</li>
                <li>Generator. Connected to the turbine by shafts and possibly gears so when the turbine spins it causes
                    the
                    generator to spin also. Converts the mechanical energy from the turbine into electric energy.
                    Generators

            <ul id="pn">
                <li>How Far the Water Falls. The farther the water falls, the more power it has. Generally, the distance
                    that the water falls depends on the size of the dam. The higher the dam, the farther the water falls
                    and the more power it has. Scientists would say that the power of falling water is "directly
                    proportional" to the distance it falls. In other words, water falling twice as far has twice as much
                    energy.</li>
                <li>Amount of Water Falling. More water falling through the turbine will produce more power. The amount
                    of water available depends on the amount of water flowing down the river. Bigger rivers have more
                    flowing water and can produce more energy. Power is also "directly proportional" to river flow. A
                    river with twice the amount of flowing water as another river can produce twice as much energy.</li>

            <h> How Hydroelectric Energy Works
            </h>
            <p>By taking advantage of gravity and the water cycle, we have tapped into one of nature's engines to create
                a
                useful form of energy. In fact, humans have been capturing the energy of moving water for thousands of
                years. Today,
                harnessing the power of moving water to generate electricity, known as hydroelectric power, is the
                largest source of
                emissions-free, renewable electricity in the United States and worldwide.

                Although the generation of hydropower does not emit air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions, it can
                have negative
                environmental and social consequences. Blocking rivers with dams can degrade water quality, damage
                aquatic and
                riparian habitat, block migratory fish passage, and displace local communities. The benefits and
                drawbacks of any
                proposed hydropower development must be weighed before moving forward with any project. Still, if it's
                done right,
                hydropower can be a sustainable and nonpolluting source of electricity that can help decrease our
                dependence on
                fossil fuels and reduce the threat of global warmin</p>
            <p>On Earth, water is constantly moved around in various states, a process known as the hydrologic cycle.
                Water evaporates from the oceans, forming into clouds, falling out as rain and snow, gathering into
                streams and rivers, and flowing back to the sea. All this movement provides an enormous opportunity to
                harness useful energy.

                In 2011, hydropower provided 16 percent of the world’s electricity, second only to fossil fuels.
                Worldwide capacity in 2011 was 950 gigawatts (GW), with 24 percent in the China, eight percent in the
                United States, and nine percent in Brazil [1]. Globally, hydroelectric capacity has more than doubled
                since 1970.

                In the United States, hydropower has grown steadily, from 56 GW of installed capacity in 1970 to more
                than 78 GW in 2011 [2]. However, as a percentage of total U.S. electricity generation, it has fallen
                from 12 percent in 1980 to 7 percent in 2012, largely as a result of the rapid growth in natural gas
                power plants and other renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar [3].

            </p>
            <p> Since hydropower depends on rivers and streams for generation, the potential to use hydropower as a
                source of electricity varies across the country. For example, the Pacific Northwest (Oregon and
                Washington) generates more than two-thirds of its electricity from hydroelectric dams [4]. The Grand
                Coulee dam on the Columbia River in Washington is one of the largest dams in the world, with a capacity
                of more than 6,750 megawatts (MW).

                In addition to very large plants in the western states, the United States has many smaller hydropower
                plants. In 1940 there were 3,100 hydropower plants across the country, though by 1980 that number had
                fallen to 1,425. Since then, a number of these small plants have been restored; as of 2013, there were
                1,672 hydro plants (not including pumped storage) in operation [5]. These plants account for only a tiny
                fraction of the dams that block and divert our rivers. </p>
            <p> In order to generate electricity from the kinetic energy in moving water, the water has to move with
                sufficient speed and volume to spin a propeller-like device called a turbine, which in turn rotates a
                generator to generate electricity. Roughly speaking, one gallon of water per second falling one hundred
                feet can generate one kilowatt of electricity.</br> To increase the volume of moving water, impoundments
                or dams are used to collect the water. An opening in the dam uses gravity to drop water down a pipe
                called a penstock. The moving water causes the turbine to spin, which causes magnets inside a generator
                to rotate and create electricity.

                There are a variety of types of turbines used at hydropower facilities, and their use depends on the
                amount of hydraulic head (vertical distance between the dam and the turbine) at the plant. The most
                common are Kaplan, Francis, and Pelton wheel designs. Some of these designs, called reaction and impulse
                wheels, use not just the kinetic force of the moving water but also the water pressure.</p>
            <p> The Kaplan turbine is similar to a boat propeller, with a runner (the turning part of a turbine) that
                has three to six blades, and can provide up to 400 MW of power. The Kaplan turbine is differentiated
                from other kinds of hydropower turbines because its performance can be improved by changing the pitch of
                the blades. The Francis turbine has a runner with nine or more fixed vanes. In this turbine design,
                which can be up to 800 MW in size, the runner blades direct the water so that it moves in an axial flow
                [6]. The Pelton turbine consists of a set of specially shaped buckets that are mounted on the outside of
                a circular disc, making it look similar to a water wheel. Pelton turbines are typically used in high
                hydraulic head sites and can be as large as 200 MW.</p>
